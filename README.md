# Sales Analysis Project (2020â€“2024)

## 1. Project Description
This project focuses on **sales analysis** for a retail store, covering data from **01/01/2020** to **31/12/2024**.  
It consists of two primary phases:
1. **Data Cleaning** with **Python**  
2. **Data Visualization** with **Power BI**  

The main objective is to derive **actionable insights** aimed at **increasing revenue** and **attracting more customers** by examining key factors such as **sales trends, customer behavior,** and **product performance**.
